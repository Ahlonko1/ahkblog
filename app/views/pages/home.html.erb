    <h3>A bit about me</h3>
    <p>What makes me as happy as Larry? When my code works!!</p>
    <p>After 8 years in Accounting, Tax and Finance,
    I recently endeavoured in the tech world by following the Web development bootcamp at Le Wagon and enjoyed it!
    Indeed coding suits my analytical background and my thirst to always keep learning as well as triggering my inner creativity.</p>
    <p>My previous experiences have provided me with the abilities to prioritize tasks and work on multiple assignments at the same time.
    I have also demonstrated adaptability in international environments and shown solid managerial skills.</p>
    <p>Today, I have SQL, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, Git/Github and JavaScript under my belt.
    I am therefore looking for any challenging opportunity that will help my next professional chapter start with a bang.</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out to me.</p>
